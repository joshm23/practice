/* When you get this code upload it to gradescope and look at the results, you will see incorrect ) 0/10 points for all problems --- but Gradescope will compile and evaluate. Your practice.c in CLion should have all the functions listed below in any practice.c you submit to gradescope or gradescope will not evaluate it.

    I would suggest that you enter your code for one function at a time, submit to practice to
    gradescope make sure it works and look at any suggestions.

    YOU CAN UPLOAD (RESUBMIT)TO GRADESCOPE AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE

    When you are satisfied with your results move on to the another function,
    but enter code for one function at a time. When you submit practice.c
    and Gradescope reports an error or fails to compile you have a serious
    code error (infinite loop or something equally toxic) In this case go to CLion and bebug your code.
    Proceed one function at a time.

    BE SURE TO REMOVE THE return STATEMENTS I HAVE PLACED IN THE FUCTIONS AND ENTER YOUR OWN. MY RETURNS
    ARE ONLY PLACEHOLDERS.
